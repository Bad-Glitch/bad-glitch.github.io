### Community Feedback

Users have praised Dante for its realistic scenarios and the depth of its challenges. Many have found it instrumental in preparing for certifications and real-world penetration testing roles.

---

### Tips for Success

- Begin by mapping out the network to understand its structure.
- Utilize enumeration tools like WinPEAS, LinPEAS, and BloodHound.
- Leverage compromised systems to gain deeper access.
- Engage with the Hack The Box community for support and insights.

## Difficulty Level

While HTB classifies Dante as an **intermediate-level lab**, it certainly pushes that boundary. The lab challenges you with:

- Complex pivoting chains
- Advanced privilege escalation
- Multi-layered Active Directory exploitation
- Deep post-exploitation enumeration

Completing Dante will significantly boost your penetration testing proficiency and readiness for real-world assessments or certifications such as **OSCP** or **CRTP**

### Pivoting Mastery

Pivoting is core to the Dante lab. Nearly every machine requires one or more pivot layers. This forces you to master tools and techniques such as:

- **SSH Tunnels** (static/dynamic)
- **Metasploit route management**
- **Proxychains**
- **Chisel**

## What You’ll Walk Away With

After completing Dante, you’ll be proficient in:

- Pivoting through segmented networks
- Active Directory enumeration and exploitation
- Crafting buffer overflow payloads
- Privilege escalation using Linux and Windows tools
- Leveraging advanced tunneling tools in real-world simulations

## Essential Tools Used

- **Ligolo-ng** – Fast, reliable tunneling for multi-hop pivots.
- **Netexec (CrackMapExec)** – Enterprise-grade credential and protocol enumeration.
- **Metasploit Framework** – Useful for routing traffic through pivots and managing exploits.
- **WinPEAS / LinPEAS** – Automated post-exploitation enumeration scripts for Windows and Linux.
- **pspy** – Privilege escalation reconnaissance on Linux without root access.
