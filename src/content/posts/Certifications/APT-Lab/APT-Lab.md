### **APTLabs - Level 4 Red Team Operator**

**Difficulty**: Expert

**Machines**: 18

**Flags**: 20

**Environment**: Enterprise Simulated WAN Network, Full Active Directory Configuration, Latest Patch Levels

---

### **What is APTLabs?**

APTLabs is a high-level, advanced Red Team challenge designed for experienced penetration testers and red team operators. It provides a unique, immersive environment built to simulate real-world enterprise technologies, including **fully patched servers**, **advanced network configurations**, and **enterprise-level security systems**. The challenge is based on a **Managed Service Provider (MSP)** scenario where an initial compromise of a client network ultimately leads to a **full domain compromise**.

This lab will push your offensive security skills to the limit, providing opportunities to explore a vast array of attack techniques, advanced TTPs (Tools, Techniques, Procedures), and attack vectors commonly seen in **real-world engagements**. It's not for the faint of heart – only the most skilled red teamers will thrive here.

### **What Makes APTLabs Unique?**

APTLabs features several elements that make it stand out from other Red Team labs:

1. **Realistic Network Infrastructure**:
    - Simulates a **real enterprise network** with complex **Active Directory** structures, **workstations**, **servers**, and **network segmentation**.
    - Participants will navigate a **simulated WAN** that closely mirrors a real enterprise environment.
2. **Advanced Attack Techniques**:
    - Includes attacks that bypass modern security defenses such as **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, **next-gen firewalls**, and **endpoint detection & response (EDR)**.
    - Offers opportunities to perform **Kerberos attacks**, **Golden Ticket attacks**, and **Lateral Movement** techniques with minimal footprint.
3. **Fully Patched Environment**:
    - Targets environments that are **fully patched**, making it an advanced challenge that focuses on attacking **misconfigurations**, **user behavior**, and **operational weaknesses** rather than exploiting unpatched CVEs.
4. **Enterprise Tools & Techniques**:
    - You will need to apply **enterprise-level tools** like **BloodHound**, **Mimikatz**, **Cobalt Strike**, **Empire**, and others to exploit weaknesses.
    - Focuses on **advanced phishing techniques**, **credential harvesting**, and **exploit development** to break into the system.
