The **Certified Red Team Specialist (CRTS) V2** is an advanced and updated training course by **CyberWarFare Labs**. It's designed to reflect real-world adversary techniques and modern red teaming tradecraft. During the webinar, they introduced the new syllabus, lab infrastructure, and explained how the course focuses on stealthy, goal-oriented red team operations.

## Key Technical Areas Covered

### 1. Initial Access

- Techniques like phishing with Office macros, OneNote payloads, HTA, ISO, and LNK files.
- Exploiting browser vulnerabilities and abusing trusted file types.

### 2. Persistence

- Using Registry Run keys, WMI events, and Scheduled Tasks.
- DLL side-loading, AppInit_DLLs abuse, and COM Hijacking.

### 3. Command & Control (C2)

- C2 tools include: SharpC2, Mythic, Covenant, and Sliver.
- Techniques: DNS-over-HTTPS, domain fronting, and AES-encrypted payloads.

### 4. Defense Evasion

- AMSI bypass using patching and reflection.
- ETW patching, in-memory payload execution, and abusing LOLBins.
- Signature mismatches and timestomping techniques.

### 5. Privilege Escalation

- Token impersonation, exploiting unquoted service paths.
- Dumping credentials using LSASS, comsvcs.dll, and tools like Mimikatz.

### 6. Lateral Movement

- Techniques like SMB Relay, PsExec, WinRM, and WMIExec.
- Kerberos attacks: Pass-the-Ticket (PTT), AS-REP Roasting, and Kerberoasting.

### 7. Infrastructure Setup

- Building redirectors using NGINX or Caddy.
- Deploying secure TLS/SSL C2 servers on platforms like DigitalOcean, AWS, and Vultr.

### 8. Active Directory Attacks

- Using tools like BloodHound and Rubeus.
- Performing ACL abuse, Golden and Silver Ticket attacks, and GPO abuse using SharpGPOAbuse.

- Red team scenarios built for stealth and realism.
- Includes blue team detections (AV, EDR, Sysmon) to improve evasion techniques.

---

## What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to plan and carry out full red team operations.
- Develop custom malware and build secure C2 infrastructure.
- Evade detection by AV/EDR/AMSI systems.
- Emulate real-world adversary behavior using MITRE ATT&CK mapping.
