# "CVE-2021-34527" PrintNightmare : From Local Privilege Escalation to Remote Domain Admin

**PrintNightmare** (CVE-2021-34527) is a **critical vulnerability** found in the **Windows Print Spooler** service. The **Print Spooler** is responsible for managing print jobs on Windows systems, both locally and over the network.

- **Vulnerable Windows Versions**: It affects multiple versions of **Windows Server** (2016, 2019), **Windows 10**, and even **Windows Server 2022**.
- The vulnerability was first publicly disclosed in **June 2021** and quickly became a major security concern, particularly after **Microsoft** released patches that were later found to be incomplete in certain configurations.

### **`Severity**:`

The exploit enables an attacker to **execute arbitrary code** and escalate privileges to **SYSTEM level** (which is the highest level on a machine). If the attacker compromises a **Domain Controller (DC)**, they can escalate further to **Domain Admin (DA)** privileges, which gives them full control over the entire network.

---

### **`2. Technical Overview of the Vulnerability`**

### **How PrintNightmare Works**:

The Print Spooler vulnerability is related to how the **Print Spooler service** handles requests from users and how it interacts with **printer drivers**. Here's what happens:

1. **Malicious Request**:
The attacker sends a **malformed request** to the **Print Spooler** service, triggering the service to **load a malicious printer driver**. This request is crafted in a way that it **overflows memory buffers** or improperly handles inputs.
2. **Buffer Overflow**:
The vulnerability allows for **buffer overflow** or other **input validation failures**, which results in the attacker’s **code execution**. The attacker can inject their own **malicious payload** into the Print Spooler’s memory space.
3. **Privilege Escalation**:
The Print Spooler service runs with **SYSTEM** privileges. This means that once the attacker is able to exploit the vulnerability, they gain full control over the machine with **SYSTEM-level access**, which can then be used to escalate to **Domain Admin** if the attack is against a **Domain Controller**.

### **Key Points**:

- The **Print Spooler** service typically runs with **high privileges** on Windows machines.
- Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**.
- A **low-privileged user** can exploit the vulnerability, meaning it doesn't require admin-level access to begin with.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary code, modify files, install malicious software, and gain remote access to the compromised system.

### **`3. Lab Setup for Exploiting PrintNightmare`**

Here’s how you could set up an environment to safely demonstrate **PrintNightmare**:

### **Tools and Components**:

- **OS**: Windows Server 2016/2019 or Windows 10 (unpatched versions).
- **Attack Machine**: Kali Linux or Windows machine with penetration testing tools installed.
    - Tools like **Impacket**, **Mimikatz**, **PowerShell** scripts, or **PrintNightmare PoC exploit code**.
- **Vulnerable Service**: The **Print Spooler service** must be **enabled and unpatched**.
- **Target Machine**: This can be either a **workstation** or **Domain Controller** (DC).

### **Preparation Steps**:

1. Ensure the **Print Spooler service** is running on the target machine.
    - Check using `sc query spooler` or `Get-Service -Name Spooler` on PowerShell.
2. Ensure the target is unpatched (use versions prior to **July 2021**).
3. **Disable Windows Defender** (if it interferes) and allow exploitation.
4. For testing, use a **non-privileged** user account to exploit the vulnerability.

### **`4. Exploit Steps: From Local Privilege Escalation to Remote Domain Admin`**

### **Step 1: Trigger the PrintNightmare Vulnerability**

To exploit **CVE-2021-34527**, an attacker would typically use a **proof-of-concept (PoC)** exploit code that targets the vulnerability in the **Print Spooler service**. These PoC exploits send specially crafted **Print Spooler requests** to cause the service to load a malicious driver.

Example with **Impacket** or **PrintNightmare PoC** exploit:

```abap
python3 [PrintNightmarePoC.py](http://printnightmarepoc.py/) <target-ip>
```

This will inject a malicious print driver into the **Print Spooler**, gaining the attacker **SYSTEM-level privileges**.

### **Step 2: Gain SYSTEM Privileges**

Once the malicious driver is loaded, the attacker gains **SYSTEM-level access** on the compromised machine. They can now execute arbitrary code or commands with full administrative privileges on the system.

At this point, the attacker can perform tasks such as:

- Installing additional tools for further exploitation.
- Collecting sensitive information such as passwords or configuration files.
- Dumping **credentials** from the system.

### **Step 3: Escalate to Domain Admin (DA) Privileges**

If the system is a **Domain Controller**, the attacker can use **Pass-the-Hash** or **Kerberos ticket manipulation** to escalate their privileges further:

1. **Dumping credentials using Mimikatz**:
After gaining **SYSTEM privileges**, the attacker can run **Mimikatz** to dump the **NTLM hashes** and potentially extract **clear-text passwords**.

```abap
mimikatz.exe "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords"
```

1. **Pass-the-Hash**:
If hashes are obtained, the attacker can use **Pass-the-Hash** attacks to authenticate as a higher-privileged user or even a **Domain Admin**.
2. **Kerberos Ticket**:
With SYSTEM access, the attacker can forge **Kerberos tickets** (TGT - Ticket Granting Ticket) and impersonate **Domain Admin**.

### **`5. Detection and Mitigation`**

### **Detection by Blue Team**:

To detect **PrintNightmare**, look for suspicious events:

1. **Event ID 5152** (Windows Firewall): Detect incoming traffic to **SMB ports (139, 445)**, which are typically involved in Print Spooler exploitation.
2. **Event ID 7045** (Service Installation): If a new **service** is installed or a **printer driver** is loaded unexpectedly, this could be an indicator of compromise.
3. **Event ID 4688** (Process Creation): Monitor **cmd.exe**, **powershell.exe**, or **spoolsv.exe** processes spawned by low-privileged users.
4. **Unusual Print Spooler Logs**: Look for **printer drivers** being loaded that do not match normal operations.

### **Mitigation Strategies**:

1. **Apply Microsoft Patches**:
    - The easiest and most effective mitigation is to install the latest security updates released by **Microsoft** for CVE-2021-34527.
    - **Windows Update** (KB5004945 and others) patches the vulnerability by modifying how the Print Spooler handles driver loading.
2. **Disable Print Spooler Service** (Temporary Mitigation):
If immediate patching is not possible, disable the **Print Spooler service** entirely:

```abap
Stop-Service -Name Spooler
Set-Service -Name Spooler -StartupType Disabled
```

1. **Limit User Permissions**:
Restrict **printer driver installation permissions** for non-administrative users.
    - Only **admin-level users** should have the ability to install printer drivers.
2. **Use Network Segmentation**:
If print services are required over the network, segment your network so that the print service is isolated and can't be accessed by unauthorized users.

---

### **`6. Patching & Future Mitigation Recommendations`**

- **Apply Critical Patches**: Always ensure that systems are patched regularly and that **Print Spooler** is updated with the latest security patches from **Microsoft**.
- **Monitor Event Logs**: Ensure that systems are actively logging events related to **printer drivers** and **spooler services** to catch malicious activity.
- **Implement Least Privilege**: Ensure that non-administrative users are prevented from interacting with services such as **Print Spooler**, especially on critical systems like **Domain Controllers**.

### **Final Thoughts on PrintNightmare**

**PrintNightmare** is one of the most severe vulnerabilities in recent history due to its ability to escalate privileges on local systems and **Domain Controllers**. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain **SYSTEM-level access**, and if a **Domain Controller** is targeted, **Domain Admin** privileges can be easily achieved. Organizations should patch this vulnerability immediately, disable the Print Spooler service if possible, and monitor for suspicious activity related to printer drivers and **spoolsv.exe** processes.
